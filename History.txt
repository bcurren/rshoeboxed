== 0.0.7 2009-02-15

* Adjusted EndDate to use GMT, which isn't the same as Shoeboxed's docs... but which a) works and b) is more permissive in terms of getting a fuller list of txns.  If Shoeboxed adjusts their code to match the docs, we can go back to EST.

== 0.0.1 2009-01-12

* 1 major enhancement:
  * Initial release
